# VideoChatApplication
### Project Description
Our target audience is people who want to have an open debate about specific subjects with people that they disagree with. These subjects can be about anything, from politics to sports to food. A secondary audience that we could see using this application is TA’s using this application as an icebreaker for students. We decided to implement a video chat instead of something like a text chat because it's a lot easier to communicate and get your ideas across when you’re talking face-to-face with someone compared to when you’re trying to communicate with them through text. This is also a way to weed out trolls, making it so that there is some amount of accountability for the things that you’re saying rather than it being behind an anonymous text chat. 
Our audience wants to use this application because they want to learn more about other sides of issues that they care about. It’s very easy to get into an echo chamber when it comes to important topics, so by actually talking with someone who has an opinion different from their own, our audience can educate themselves on the opposite side, and even learn more about their own stance. 
	We want to build this application because we feel that it could be a good way for people who have differing ideologies on a topic to understand the underlying thoughts that a person with a different opinion on the subject matter might have. It would also use a lot of the techniques we have learned in this class.
